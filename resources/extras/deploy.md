# Where to host you UserBot
Choosing your hosting options is a very hot issue where everyone gets puzzled at first. But the factors that come into play here **how much you can afford, how much time you can invest and how skilled you're in programming.**
|Platform| Time to deploy | Updates |   Configurabliity | Price |
| :----- | :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------ | :----|
| Cloud  | `Short`        | Mostly Automatic |Might need support team| A bit pricey but many free options|
| VPS    | `A bit long`   | Mighe be automic need supervision |Unlimited Control over your configs| Cheap-ish Mostly Paid|
| Others | `Mostly very long` | mostly manual |Hard to configure| Free|

So we can conclude if you are broke and don't know much techniality go for cloud but if you're not that bad with tech try VPS options as well. If you have some time, little money and know you way around computers go for VPS they proivde good control.If you're broke and know programmming go for the free VPS options we don't recommend the other options like turning front-end based sites into userbots servers.
